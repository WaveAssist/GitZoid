## Overview

GitZoid is an **open-source** GitHub bot that automates pull-request reviews and comments using AI models (OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5). By default, it’s designed to run on the [WaveAssist](https://waveassist.io) platform—which handles node orchestration, scheduling, secrets/variable storage, and hosting—but you can also run it as a standalone Python application.

👉 You can try out the **hosted version** of GitZoid at [https://gitzoid.com](https://gitzoid.com) — no setup required.

## Features

  Seed your list of repositories into WaveAssist or a local store.

## 🚀 One-Click Deploy with WaveAssist

Deploy GitZoid instantly using the button below:

[![Deploy with WaveAssist](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy_with-WaveAssist-007F3B?style=for-the-badge)](https://waveassist.io/templates/gitzoid-template)

### How to Use:

1. **Deploy** by clicking on this link: [Deploy GitZoid](https://waveassist.io/templates/gitzoid-template).
   - You’ll be taken to WaveAssist, where you can customize the deployment.
   - **Note**: You need a WaveAssist account (free forever tier available).

2. Once deployed, go to your project and go to the **Variables tab** (you'll see it pre-created) and **paste in your values for**:
   - `github_ghp_token`
   - `openai_key` or `anthropic_key`

3. Now, go to the **Nodes tab**:
   - Trigger `InitializeRepositories` once (only needed the first time).
   - Review the `repositories` variable if you'd like to prune/edit.

4. Trigger `FetchPRs`. Within seconds, GitZoid will:
   - Fetch PRs
   - Review them using AI
   - Post comments directly on your GitHub PRs

5. ✅ Once everything works, click the **Deploy** button in WaveAssist to make it run on schedule automatically.

### Optional: Enable Real-Time Reviews via GitHub Webhooks

Want GitZoid to respond to new PRs in real-time?

- Go to the **`FetchPRs` node** in WaveAssist
- Copy the **Webhook URL**
- Add it as a GitHub webhook for your repo:
  - Events to select: `Pull requests`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Content-Type: `application/json`

GitZoid will now review PRs as soon as they're opened.

## Manual Deployment (Advanced)

You can also run each script locally or schedule with your own orchestrator (like cron or Airflow). But WaveAssist is easier.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Repositories** (`initialize_repositories.py`)
   - Trigger-only. Seeds your repository list to the `repositories` variable.

2. **Fetch Pull Requests** (`fetch_pull_requests.py`)
   - Scheduled or webhook-triggered.
   - Loads your repos and GHP token.
   - Fetches open PRs and diffs → stores them in `prs_to_review`.

3. **Generate Reviews** (`generate_review.py`)
   - Run after FetchPRs.
   - Uses AI to generate suggestions/comments.
   - Adds review to each PR entry.

4. **Post Comments** (`post_comment.py`)
   - Posts the AI review back to the PR on GitHub.
